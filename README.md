# Gamon
**Gamon \<Hero of Orgrimmar\>** is a Tauren Warrior NPC located in Valley of Strength within the city of Orgrimmar.

Just kidding.

Gamon is a Discord bot that can simulate and predict how completing Mythic+ dungeons at certain keystone levels might impact a character's Mythic+ rating. This bot is based on [Mythic Rating Helper](https://github.com/Coryrin/mr-helper) and has been modified to work within the Discord server for the World of Warcraft guild The Last Dynasty (US - Thrall).

With the changes to Mythic+ dungeons and scoring that came along with The War Within, the new calculation formulas are based on [Rating Calculator](https://github.com/SamFarah/RatingCalculator) which is available in web browsers at https://www.mythicplanner.com.

What Gamon can do for you:
- Simulate a character running all Mythic+ dungeons at a single keystone level
- Tell which dungeons a character could run and time to slightly improve their Mythic+ rating
- Provide a plan for dungeons a character can complete to reach a goal Mythic+ rating
