# TLD Mythic Rating Helper
Mythic Rating Helper is a discord bot which can be used to check a character's mythic runs, and return to them which dungeons would improve their overall mythic rating score. This version of Mythic Rating Helper has been modified from the original version and is currently intended for use within the Discord server for the World of Warcraft guild The Last Dynasty (US - Thrall).
