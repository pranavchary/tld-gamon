# TLD Mythic Rating Helper
Mythic Rating Helper is a Discord bot which can provide information about completing Mythic+ dungeons at certain keystone levels and how that might impact a character's Mythic+ rating. This version of Mythic Rating Helper has been modified and is currently meant to work within the Discord server for the World of Warcraft guild The Last Dynasty (US - Thrall).

Some operations this bot can perform:
- Simulate a character running all Mythic+ dungeons at a single keystone level
- Tell which dungeons a character could run to slightly improve their Mythic+ rating
- Provide a plan for dungeons a character can complete to reach a goal Mythic+ rating
